# Facenet Embeddings for Faces
Create an embedding of faces using facenet from google paper. 

## About Project
Clustering(or grouping) similar face identity from the set of given image data. 
> This project is similar to google photos grouping. 


## TODO -  
1. Get the dataset with face images 
2. Create face embeddings from facenet:
    - [ ] Detecting the face
    - [ ] creating a embeddings 
    - [ ] store the files with targets. 
3. Using either K-Means or Agglomerative clustring to cluster the similar identity faces.
