# Facenet Embeddings for Faces
Create an embedding of faces using facenet from google paper. 

## TODO: 
1. Get the dataset with face images 
2. Create face embeddings from facenet:
    - [ ] Detecting the face
    - [ ] creating a embeddings 
    - [ ] store the files with targets. 
3. Using either K-Means or Agglomerative clustring to cluster the similar identity faces.
